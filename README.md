# Pareto
Project: Analyzing Homepage Products Using the Pareto Principle

Introduction
This project is based on the idea of leveraging the Pareto Principle (the classic 80/20 rule) to verify if the showcase or homepage of a website shows a distribution where a minority of products (about 20%) generates the majority of interactions, sales, or views (about 80%). The goal is to identify these high-impact items and periodically update the featured selection to maximize the website's performance.

Project Objectives
•	Verification of the Pareto Principle: Analyze product interaction data on the homepage to confirm the presence of the Pareto phenomenon or not.
•	Identification of Key Products: Identify the top 20% of products that contribute to 80% of traffic or conversions, providing valuable insights for marketing and merchandising strategies.
•	Periodic Updates: Automate the monitoring process to periodically update the featured products, keeping the homepage current and optimized based on real performance data.
•	Showcase Optimization: Use analysis to highlight the right products, thus improving the user experience and sales results.

Methodology
1.	Data Collection:
Gather data on views, clicks and sales.
2.	Data Analysis:
Use Python with specific libraries to perform statistical analysis and verify the Pareto distribution. The analysis aims to determine whether 20% of the products generate 80% of the results.
3.	Result Visualization:
Create interactive dashboards and reports.
4.	Automating Updates:
Dynamically update the homepage to highlight products with the best performance.

Technologies Used
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
•	Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib
•	Databases: SQL
